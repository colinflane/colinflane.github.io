			<h2 id="1">1: Orientation</h2>
			<p>Here I make a digression to illustrate what is often called "back-of-the-envelope calculations." I have frequently observed great scientists and engineers do this much more often than the "run-of-the-mill" people, hence it requires illustration.</p>
			<p>I read somewhere there are 76 different methods of predicting the future -- but the very number suggests there is no reliable method which is widely accepted. The most trivial method is to predict tomorrow will be exactly the same as today -- which at times is a good bet. The next level of sophistication is to use the current rates of change and to suppose that they will stay the same -- linear prediction in the variable used. Which variable you use can, of course, strongly affect the prediction made! Both methods are not much good for long-term predictions, however.</p>
			<p>History is often used as a long-term guide; some people believe history repeats itself and others believe exactly the opposite! It is obvious:
			<blockquote><strong>The past was once the future and the future will become the past.</strong></blockquote></p>
			<p>In any case, I will often use history as a background for the extrapolations I make. I believe the best predictions are based on understanding the fundamental forces involved, and this is what I depend on mainly. Often it is not physical limitations which control but rather it is human-made laws, habits, and organizational rules, regulations, personal egos, and inertia which dominate the evolution to the future.</p>
			<p>There is a saying, "Short-term predictions are always optimistic and long-term predictions are always pessimistic." The reason, so itis claimed, the second part is true is that for most people the geometric growth due to the compounding of knowledge is hard to grasp. For example, for money, a mere 6% annual growth doubles the money in about 12 years! In 48 years the growth is a factor of 16. An example of the truth of this claim that most long-term predictions are low is the growth of the computer field in speed, in density of components, in drop in price, etc., as well as the spread of computers into the many corners of life. But the field of artificial intelligence (AI) provides a very good counterexample. Almost all the leaders in the field made long-term predictions which have almost never come true, and are not likely to do so within your lifetime, though many will in the fullness of time.</p>

			<p>It is probable the future will be more limited by the slow evolution of the human animal and the corresponding human laws, social institutions, and organizations than it will be by the rapid evolution of technology.</p>

			<p>In spite of the difficulty of predicting the future and that
			<blockquote><strong>unforeseen technological inventions can completely upset the most careful predictions,</strong></blockquote>
			you must try to foresee the future you will face. To illustrate the importance of this point of trying to foresee the future I often use a standard story.</p>
			<p>It is well known the drunken sailor who staggers to the left or right with <em>n</em> independent random steps will, on the average, end up about <em>√n</em> steps from the origin. But if there is a pretty girl in one direction, then his steps will tend to go in that direction and he will go a distance proportional to <em>n</em>. In a lifetime of many, many independent choices, small and large, a career with a vision will get you a distance proportional to <em>n</em>, while no vision will get you only the distance <em>√n</em>. In a sense, the main difference between those who go far and those who do not is some people have a vision and the others do not and therefore can only react to the current events as they happen.</p>
			<p>You will probably object that if you try to get a vision now it is likely to be wrong -- and my reply is that from observation I have seen the accuracy of the vision matters less than you might suppose, getting anywhere is better than drifting, there are potentially many paths to greatness for you, and just which path you go on, <em>so long as it takes you to greatness</em>, is none of my business. You must, as in the case of forging your personal style, find your vision of your future career, and then follow it as best you can.
			<blockquote><strong>No vision, not much of a future.</strong></blockquote></p>
			<p>To what extent history does or does not repeat itself is a moot question. But it is one of the few guides you have... The other main tool I have used is an active imagination in trying to see what will happen... In forming your plan for your future you need to distinguish three different questions:
				<ol type="1"><strong>
					<li>What is possible?</li>
					<li>What is likely to happen?</li>
					<li>What is desirable to have happen?</li>
				</strong></ol>
			In a sense the first is science -- what is possible. The second is engineering -- what are the human factors which choose the one future that does happen from the ensemble of all possible futures. The third is ethics, morals, or whatever other word you wish to apply to value judgments. It is important to examine all three questions, and insofar as the second differs from the third, you will probably have an idea of how to alter things to make the more desirable future occur, rather than let the inevitable happen and suffer the consequences. Again, you can see why having a vision is what tends to separate the leaders from the followers.</p>

			<h2 id="2">2: Foundations of the digital (discrete) revolution</h2>
			<p>We should note here <em>transmission through space</em> (typically signaling) is the same as <em>transmission through time</em> (storage).</p>
			<h3>From Material Goods to Information Services</h3>
			<p>Society is steadily moving from a material goods society to an information service society. At the time of the American Revolution, say 1780 or so, over 90% of the people were essentially farmers -- now farmers are a very small percentage of workers. Similarly, before WWII most workers were in factories -- now less than half are there. In 1993, there were more people in government (excluding the military) than there were in manufacturing! What will the situation be in 2020? As a guess I would say less than 25% of the people in the civilian workforce will be handling things; the rest will be handling information in some form or other. In making a movie or a TV program you are making not so much a thing, though of course it does have a material form, as you are organizing information. Information is, of course, stored in a material form, say a book (the essence of a book is information), but information is not a material good to be consumed like food, a house, clothes, an automobile, or an airplane ride for transportation.</p>

			<h3>Equivalent Design</h3>
			<p>When we first passed from hand accounting to machine accounting we found it necessary, for economical reasons if no other, to somewhat alter the accounting system. Similarly, when we passed from strict hand fabrication to machine fabrication we passed from mainly screws and bolts to rivets and welding.
			<blockquote><strong>It has rarely proved practical to produce exactly the same product by machines as we produced by hand.</strong></blockquote>
			Indeed, one of the major items in the conversion from hand to machine production is the imaginative redesign of an <em>equivalent product</em>. Thus in thinking of mechanizing a large organization, it won't work if you try to keep things in detail exactly the same, rather there must be a larger give and take if there is to be a significant success. You must get the essentials of the job in mind and then design the mechanization to do that job rather than trying to mechanize the current version -- if you want a significant success in the long run.</p>
			<h3>Micromanagement</h3>
			<p>The effects on society are large. The most obvious illustration is that computers have given top management the power to <em>micromanage</em> their organization, and top management has shown little or no ability to resist using this power.<p>
			<p>Among other evils of micromanagement is lower management does not get the chance to make responsible decisions and learn from their mistakes, but rather, because the older people finally retire, then lower management finds itself as top management -- without having had many real experiences in management!</p>
			<p>Furthermore, central planning has been repeatedly shown to give poor results (consider the Russian experiment, for example, or our own bureaucracy). The persons on the spot usually have better knowledge than can those at the top and hence can often (not always) make better decisions if things are not micromanaged. The people at the bottom do not have the larger, global view, but at the top they do not have the local view of all the details, many of which can often be very important, so <em>either extreme gets poor results</em>.</p>
			<aside><p>à la James C Scott's <em>Seeing Like a State</em></p></aside>
			<p>Next, an idea which arises in the field, based on the direct experience of the people doing the job, cannot get going in a centrally controlled system since the managers did not think of it themselves. The <em>not invented here</em> (NIH) syndrome is one of the major curses of our society, and computers, with their ability to encourage micromanagement, are a significant factor.</p>
			<p>There is slowly, but apparently definitely, coming a counter trend to micromanagement. Loose connections between small, somewhat independent organizations are gradually arising... I believe you can expect to see much more of this loose association between small organizations as a defense against micromanagement from the top, which occurs so often in big organizations. There has always been some independence of subdivisions in organizations, but the power to micromanage from the top has apparently destroyed the conventional liens and autonomy of decision making -- and I doubt the ability of most top managements to resist for long the power to micromanage. I also doubt many large companies will be able to give up micromanagement; most will probably be replaced in the long run by smaller organizations without the cost (overhead) and errors of top management. Thus computers are affecting the very structure of how society does its business, and for the moment apparently for the worse in this area.</p>

			<h3>Human & Machine Roles</h3>
			<p>I believe computers will be almost everywhere, since I once saw a sign which read, "The battlefield is no place for the human being." Similarly for situations requiring constant decision making. The many advantages of machines over humans were listed near the end of the last chapter, and it is hard to get around these advantages, though they are certainly not everything. Clearly the role of humans will be quite different from what it has traditionally been, but many of you will insist on old theories you were taught long ago as if they would be automatically true in the long future. It will be the same in business much of what is now taught is based on the past, and has ignored the computer revolution and our responses to some of the evils the revolution has brought; the gains are generally clear to management, the evils are less so.</p>
			<h2 id="3">3: History of computers -- hardware</h2>
			<p>The first commercial production of electronic computers was under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eckert–Mauchly_Computer_Corporation">Mauchly and Eckert</a> again, and since the company they formed was merged with another, their machines were finally called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNIVAC">UNIVACs</a>. Especially noted was the one for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Census_Bureau">Census Bureau</a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM">IBM</a> came in a bit late with 18 (20 if you count secret cryptographic users) IBM <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_701">701s</a>. I well recall a group of us, after a session on the IBM 701 at a meeting where they talked about the proposed 18 machines, all believed this would saturate the market for many years! <strong>Our error was simply we thought only of the kinds of things we were currently doing, and did not think in the directions of entirely new applications of machines.</strong> The best experts at the time were flatly wrong! And not by a small amount either! Nor for the last time!</p>
			<h3>Machine as Thing</h3>
			<p>We see the machine does not know where it has been, nor where it is going to go; it has at best only a myopic view of simply repeating the same cycle endlessly. Below this level the individual gates and two-way storage devices do not know any meaning -- they simply react to what they are supposed to do. They too have no global knowledge of what is going on, nor any meaning to attach to any bit, whether storage or gating.</p>
			<p>I am reviewing this so you will be clear the machine processes bits of information according other bits, and as far ashore machine is concerned there is no <em>meaning</em> to anything which happens -- <em>it is we who attach meaning to the bits</em>. The machine is a "machine" in the classical sense; it does what it does and nothing else (unless it malfunctions). There are, of course, real-time interrupts, and other ways new bits get into the machine, but to the machine they are only bits.</p>
