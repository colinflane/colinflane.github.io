			<h4>Chapter 4. The Third Son, Alyosha</h4>
			<p>Fyodor Pavlovich Karamazov<p>
			<p>'I have already mentioned that he had grown very bloated.' 'His <em>physiognomy</em> by that time presented <em>something</em> that <em>testified acutely</em> to the <em>characteristics</em> and <em>essence</em> of his <em>whole life</em>.'</p>
			<ul>
				<li>'long, fleshy bags under his eternally insolent, suspicious, and leering little eyes'</li>
				<li>'multitude of deep wrinkles on his fat little face'</li>
				<li>'big Adam's apple, fleshy and oblong like a purse, hung below his sharp chin, giving him a sort of repulsively sexual appearance'</li>
				<li>'long, carnivorous mouth with plump lips'</li>
				<li>'little stumps of black, almost decayed teeth'</li>
				<li>'sprayed saliva whenever he spoke'</li>
				<li>'his nose, which was not very big, but was very thin and noticeably hooked'</li>
				<li>'"A real Roman one," he used to say. "Along with my Adam's apple, it gives me the real physiognomy of an ancient Roman patrician of the decadent period." He seemed to be proud of it.'</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Chapter 5. Elders</h4>
			<p>Alyosha / Zosima</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>Oh, how well he understood that for the humble soul of the simple Russian, worn out by toil and grief, and, above all, by everlasting injustice and everlasting sin, his own and the world's, there is no stronger need and consolation than to find some holy thing or person, to fall down before him and venerate him: 'Though with us there is sin, unrighteousness, and temptation, all the same, there is on earth, in such and such a place, somewhere, someone holy and exalted; he has the truth; he knows the truth; so the truth does not die on earth, and therefore someday it will come to us and it will reign over all the earth, as has been promised.'</p>
			</blockquote>

				<li>as opposed to 'students of both sexes who, in our capitals, from morning till night, habitually haunt the doorways of various newspapers and magazines, unable to invent anything better than the eternal repetition of one and the same plea for copying work or translations from the French'</li>
				<li>made connections with the others, published 'rather talented' reviews of books on 'various specific subjects', became known in some literary circles</li>
				<li>became household name by publishing in one of the big newspapers a 'strange' article on the issue of ecclesiastical courts, which was, despite its tone and 'remarkable' conclusion, and the fact he had graduated in natural science, first embraced by the churchmen, then the secularists and even the atheists, until finally being understood as a farce and mockery</li>
