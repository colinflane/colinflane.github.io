			<h4>Chapter 4. The Third Son, Alyosha</h4>
			<p>Fyodor Pavlovich Karamazov<p>
			<p>'I have already mentioned that he had grown very bloated.' 'His <em>physiognomy</em> by that time presented <em>something</em> that <em>testified acutely</em> to the <em>characteristics</em> and <em>essence</em> of his <em>whole life</em>.'</p>
			<ul>
				<li>'long, fleshy bags under his eternally insolent, suspicious, and leering little eyes'</li>
				<li>'multitude of deep wrinkles on his fat little face'</li>
				<li>'big Adam's apple, fleshy and oblong like a purse, hung below his sharp chin, giving him a sort of repulsively sexual appearance'</li>
				<li>'long, carnivorous mouth with plump lips'</li>
				<li>'little stumps of black, almost decayed teeth'</li>
				<li>'sprayed saliva whenever he spoke'</li>
				<li>'his nose, which was not very big, but was very thin and noticeably hooked'</li>
				<li>'"A real Roman one," he used to say. "Along with my Adam's apple, it gives me the real physiognomy of an ancient Roman patrician of the decadent period." He seemed to be proud of it.'</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Chapter 5. Elders</h4>
			<p>Alyosha / Zosima</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>Oh, how well he understood that for the humble soul of the simple Russian, worn out by toil and grief, and, above all, by everlasting injustice and everlasting sin, his own and the world's, there is no stronger need and consolation than to find some holy thing or person, to fall down before him and venerate him: 'Though with us there is sin, unrighteousness, and temptation, all the same, there is on earth, in such and such a place, somewhere, someone holy and exalted; he has the truth; he knows the truth; so the truth does not die on earth, and therefore someday it will come to us and it will reign over all the earth, as has been promised.'</p>
			</blockquote>
			<h4>Chapter 3. Second Marriage, Second Children</h4>

				<li>first giving lessons at twenty kopecks an hour</li>
				<li>then running around to newspaper publishers, plying them with ten-line articles on street incidents, signed 'eyewitness'</li>
				<li>as opposed to 'students of both sexes who, in our capitals, from morning till night, habitually haunt the doorways of various newspapers and magazines, unable to invent anything better than the eternal repetition of one and the same plea for copying work or translations from the French'</li>
				<li>made connections with the others, published 'rather talented' reviews of books on 'various specific subjects', became known in some literary circles</li>
				<li>became household name by publishing in one of the big newspapers a 'strange' article on the issue of ecclesiastical courts, which was, despite its tone and 'remarkable' conclusion, and the fact he had graduated in natural science, first embraced by the churchmen, then the secularists and even the atheists, until finally being understood as a farce and mockery</li>

			<h3>Book Two: An Inappropriate Gathering</h3>
			<h4>Chapter 1. They Arrive at the Monastery</h4>
			<p><strong>holy fooling</strong></p>
			<p>"How am I bothering you, Pyotr Alexandrovich? Just look," he cried suddenly, stepping inside the wall of the hermitage, "what a vale of roses they live in!"</p>
			<p>Indeed, though there were no roses, there were many rare and beautiful autumn flowers, wherever there was room for them. They were obviously tended by an expert hand. There were flowerbeds within the church fences and between the graves. The little house where the elder had his cell, wooden, one-storied, with a front porch, was also surrounded with flowers.</p>
			<p>"Was it like this in the time of the previous elder, Varsonofy? They say he didn't like such niceties, they say he used to jump up and beat even ladies with a stick," Fyodor Pavlovich remarked as he went up the steps.</p>
			<p>"The elder Varsonofy indeed sometimes seemed like a holy fool, but much of what is said about him is nonsense. ..."</p>
			<aside><p>Whose is the 'expert hand' which tends to the 'rare and beautiful' flowers?</p></aside>
			<h4>Chapter 3. Women of Faith</h4>
			<p><strong>shriekers</strong></p>
			<p>The elder stood on the top step, put on his stole, and began to bless the women who crowded towards him. A "shrieker" was pulled up to him by both hands. She no sooner saw the elder than she suddenly began somehow absurdly screeching, hiccuping, and shaking all over as if in convulsions. The elder, having covered her head with the stole, read a short prayer over her, and she at once became quiet and calmed down. I do not know how it is now, but in my childhood I often used to see and hear these "shriekers" in villages and monasteries. Taken to the Sunday liturgy, they would screech or bark like dogs so that the whole church could hear, but when the chalice was brought out, and they were led up to the chalice, the "demonic possession" would immediately cease and the sick ones would always calm down for a time. As a child, I was greatly struck and astonished by this. And it was then that I heard from some landowners and especially from my town teachers, in answer to my questions, that it was all a pretense in order to avoid work, and that it could always be eradicated by the proper severity, which they confirmed by telling various stories. But later on I was surprised to learn from medical experts that there is no pretense in it, that it is a terrible woman's disease that seems to occur predominantly in our Russia, that it is a testimony to to the hard lot of our peasant women, caused by exhausting work too soon after difficult, improper birth-giving without any medical help, and, besides that, by desperate grief, beatings, and so on, which the nature of some women, as the general examples show, cannot endure. This strange and instant healing of the frenzied and struggling woman the moment she was brought to the chalice, which used to be explained to me as shamming and, moreover, almost as a trick arranged by the "clericals" themselves -- this healing occurred, probably, also in a very natural way: both the women who brought her to the chalice and, above all, the sick woman herself, fully believed, as an unquestionable truth, that the unclean spirit that possessed the sick woman could not possibly endure if she, the sick woman, were brought to the chalice and made to bow before it. And therefore, in a nervous and certainly also mentally ill woman, there always occurred (and had to occur), at the moment of her bowing before the chalice, an inevitable shock, as it were, to her whole body, a shock provoked by expectation of the inevitable miracle of healing and by the most complete faith that it would occur. And it would occur, even if only for a moment. That is just what happened now, as soon as the elder covered the woman with his stole.</p>

			<h2>Part II</h2>
			<h3>Book Four: Strains</h3>
			<h4> Chapter 1. Father Ferapont</h4>
			<p>"I have taught you for so many years, and therefore spoken aloud for so many years, that it has become a habit, as it were, to speak, and, speaking, to teach you, so much so that I would find it almost more difficult to be silent than to speak, my dear fathers and brothers, even now in my weakness," he joked, looking tenderly upon those who crowded around him. Later Alyosha recalled something of what he said then. But though he spoke distinctly and in a sufficiently firm voice, his talk was rather incoherent. He spoke of many things, he seemed to want to say everything, to speak one last time before the moment of death, to say all that had not been said in his life, and not only for the sake of instruction, but as if he wished to share his joy and ecstasy with all, to pour out his heart once more in this life...</p>
			<p>"Remember, young man, unceasingly," Father Paissy began directly, without any preamble, "that the science of this world, having united itself into a great force, has, especially in the past century, examined everything heavenly that has been bequeathed to us in scared books, and, after hard analysis, the learned ones of this world have absolutely nothing left of what was once holy. But they have examined parts and missed the whole, and their blindness is even worthy of wonder. Meanwhile the whole stands before their eyes as immovably as ever, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. Did it not live for nineteen centuries, does it not live even now in the movements of individual souls and in the movements of the popular masses? Even in the movements of the souls of those same all-destroying atheists, it lives, as before, immovably! For those who renounce Christianity and rebel against it are in their essence of the same image of the same Christ, and such they remain, for until now neither their wisdom nor the ardor of their hearts has been able to create another, higher image of man and his dignity than the image shown of old by Christ. And whatever their attempts, the results have been only monstrosities. ..."</p>
