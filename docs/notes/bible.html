			<h4>Camels</h4>
			<p><strong>3:1-4</strong> In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judea, 'Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.' Now John wore a garment of <em>camel's</em> hair, and a leather girdle around his waist; and his food was locusts and wild honey.</p>
			<p><strong>19:20-24</strong> The young man said to him, 'All these [commandments] I have observed; what do I still lack?' Jesus said to him, 'If you would be perfect, go, sell what you possess and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.' When the young man heard this he went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions.<br>
			And Jesus said to his disciples, 'Truly, I say to you, it will be hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven. Again I tell you, it is easier for a <em>camel</em> to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.'</p>
			<p><strong>23:23-24</strong> 'Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you tithe mint and dill and cumin, and have neglected the weightier matters of the law, justice and mercy and faith; these you ought to have done, without neglecting the others. You blind guides, straining out a gnat and swallowing a <em>camel</em>!'</p>

			</ul>
			<aside><p><em>Camels</em> are referenced to evoke discrepancies in size, stature, effect, intent (eye of the needle, gnats)<br>
			Likewise, the narrow and the wide gate</p></aside>
			<p><strong>7:13-14</strong> 'Enter by the narrow gate; for the gate is wide and the way is easy, that leads to destruction, and those who enter by it are many. For the gate is narrow and the way is hard, that leads to life, and those who find it are few.'</p>
			<h4>The Beatitudes 5:3-11</h4>
			<p>Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</p>
			<p>Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.</p>
			<p>Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.</p>
			<p>Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied.</p>
			<p>Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.</p>
			<p>Blessed are the poor in heart, for they shall see God.</p>
			<p>Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</p>
			<p>Blessed are you when men revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account. Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven, for men so persecuted the prophets who were before you.</p>

			<h4>The Lord's Prayer 6:9-13</h4>
			<p>Our Father who art in heaven,<br>
			Hallowed be thy name.<br>
			Thy kingdom come,<br>
			Thy will be done,<br>
			On earth as it is in heaven.<br>
			Give us this day our daily bread;<br>
			And forgive us our debts,<br>
			As we also have forgiven our debtors;<br>
			And lead us not into temptation<br>
			But deliver us from evil.</p>
			<h4>Peace, and the Sword; God, and Family 11:34-39</h4>
			<p>'Do not think that I have come to bring peace on earth; I have not come to bring peace, but a sword. For I have come to set a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; and a man's foes will be those of his own household, he who loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; and he who does not take his cross and follow me is not worthy of me. He who finds his life will lose it, and he who loses his life for my sake will find it.'</p>

			<h4>More Sermon on the Mount</h4>
			<p><strong>6:19-21</strong> 'Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust consume and where thieves break in and steal, but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust consumes and thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.'</p>
			<p><strong>6:22-23</strong> 'The eye is the lamp of the body. So, if your eye is sound, your whole body will be full of light; but if your eye is not sound, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!'</p>
			<p><strong>6:24</strong> 'No one can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.'</p>
			<p><strong>6:25-33</strong> 'Therefore, I tell you, do not be anxious about your life, what you shall eat or what you shall drink, nor about your body, what you shall put on. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing? Look at the birds of the air; they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns; and yet your Heavenly Father feeds them. <em>Are you not of more value than they?</em> And which of you by being anxious can add one cubit to his span of life? And why are you anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they neither toil nor spin; yet I tell you, even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon">Solomon</a> in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is alive and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not much more clothe you, o men of little faith? Therefore do not be anxious, saying, "What shall we eat?" or "What shall we drink?" or "What shall we wear?" For the Gentiles seek all these things; and your heavenly Father knows that you need them all. But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things shall be yours as well.'</p>

			<h3 id="heb">Hebrews</h3>
			<p><strong>6:7-8</strong> For land which has drunk the rain that often falls upon it, and brings forth vegetation useful to those for whose sake it is cultivated, receives a blessing from God. But if it bears thorns and thistles, it is worthless and near to being cursed; its end is to be burned.</p>
			<p><strong>7:12</strong> For when there is a change in the priesthood, there is necessarily a change in the law as well.</p>
			<p><strong>13:1-5</strong> Let brotherly love continue. Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers, for thereby some have entertained angels unawares. Remember those who are in prison, as though in prison with them; and those who are ill-treated, since you also are in the body. Let marriage be held in honor among all, and let the marriage bed be undefiled; for God will judge the immoral and adulterous. Keep your life free from love of money, and be content with what you have; for he has said, "I will never fail you nor forsake you."<br>

			<h3 id="jas">James</h3>
			<p><strong>1:12-15</strong> Blessed is the man who endures trial, for when he has stood the test he will receive the crown of life which God has promised to those who love him. Let no one say when he is tempted, "I am tempted by God"; for God cannot be tempted with evil and he himself tempts no one but each person is tempted when he is lured and enticed by his own desire. Then desire when it has conceived gives birth to sin; and sin when it is full-grown brings forth death.</p>
			<p><strong>2:8-13</strong> If you really fulfil the royal law, according to the scripture, "You shall love your neighbor as yourself," you do well. But if you show partiality, you commit sin, and are convicted by the law as transgressors. For whoever keeps the whole law but fails in one point has become guilty of all of it. For he who said, "Do not commit adultery," said also, "Do not kill." If you do not commit adultery but do kill, you have become a transgressor of the law. So speak and so act as those who are to be judged under the law of liberty. <strong>For judgment is without mercy to one who has shown no mercy; yet mercy triumphs over judgment.</strong></p>
			<p><strong>8:14-17</strong> What does it profit, my brethren, if a man says he has faith but has not works? Can his faith save him? If a brother or sister is ill-clad and in lack of daily food, and one of you says to them, "Go in peace, be warmed and filled," without giving them the things needed for the body, what does it profit? So faith by itself, if it has no works, is dead.</p>
			<p><strong>4:13-17</strong> Come now, you who say, "Today or tomorrow we will go into such and such a town and spend a year there and trade and get gain"; whereas <strong>you do not know about tomorrow. What is your life? For you are a mist that appears for a little time and then vanishes.</strong> Instead you ought to say, "If the Lord wills, we shall live and we shall do this or that/" As it is, you boast in your arrogance. All such boasting is evil. Whoever knows what is right to do and fails to do it, for him it is sin.</p>
			<h3 id="rev">Revelation</h3>
			<p><strong>4:6-8</strong> and before the throne there is as it were a sea of glass, like crystal.<br>
			And round the throne, on each side of the throne, are four living creatures, full of eyes in front and behind: the first living creature like a lion, the second living creature like an ox, the third living creature with the face of a man, and the fourth living creature like a flying eagle. And the four living creatures, each of them six wings, are full of eyes all round and within, and day and night they never cease to sing,<br>
			"Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord God Almighty,<br>
			who was and is and is to come!"</p>
			<aside><p>Akin to the creatures, surrounded by eyes set within whirring wheels within wheels, in Ezekiel</p></aside>
			<h4><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_seals">Seven Seals</a></h4>
			<p><strong>5:1-5</strong> And I saw in the right hand of him who was seated on the throne a scroll written within and on the back, sealed with seven seals; and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, "Who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals?" And no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll or to look into it. Then one of the elders said to me, "Weep not; lo, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has conquered, so that he can open the scroll and its seven seals."</p>
			<h4><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamb_of_God">Lamb of God</a></h4>
			<p><strong>5:6-8</strong> And between the throne and the four living creatures and among the elders, I saw a Lamb standing, as though it had been slain, with seven horns and with seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent out into all the earth; and he went and took the scroll from the right hand of him who was seated on the throne. And when he had taken the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each holding a harp, and with golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints</p>
			<h4><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Horsemen_of_the_Apocalypse">Four Horsemen</a></h4>
			<p><strong>6:1-8</strong> Now I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four living creatures say, as with a voice of thunder, "Come!" And I saw, and behold, a white horse, and its rider had a bow; and a crown was given to him, and he went out conquering and to conquer.<br>
			When he opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature say, "Come!" And out came another horse, bright red; its rider was permitted to take peace from the earth, so that men should slay one another; and he was given a great sword.<br>
			When he opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say, "Come!" And I saw, and behold, a black horse, and its rider had a balance in his hand; and I heard what seemed to be a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying, "A quart of wheat for a denarius, and three quarts of barley for a denarius; but do not harm oil and wine!"<br>
			When he opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say, "Come!" And I saw, and behold, a pale horse, and its rider's name was Death, and Hades followed him; and they were given power over a fourth of the earth, to kill with sword and with famine and with pestilence and by wild beasts of the earth.</p>
			<h4>Silence in Heaven</h4>
			<p><strong>8:1-5</strong> When the Lamb opened the seventh seal, there was a silence in heaven for about half an hour. Then I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given to them. And another angel came and stood at the altar with a golden censer; and he was given much incense to mingle with the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar before the throne; and the smoke of the incense rose with the prayers of the saints from the hand of the angel before God. Then the angel took the censer and filled it with fire from the altar and threw it on the earth; and there were peals of thunder, loud noises, flashes of lightning, and an earthquake.</p>
			<h4>Locusts of the Bottomless Pit</h4>
			<p><strong>9:1-11</strong> And the fifth angel blew his trumpet, and I saw a star fallen from heaven to the earth, and he was given the key of the shaft of the bottomless pit; he opened the shaft of the bottomless pit, and from the shaft rose smoke like the smoke of a great furnace, and the sun and the air were darkened with the smoke from the shaft. Then from the smoke came locusts on the earth, and they were given power like the power of scorpions of the earth; they were told not to harm the grass of the earth or any green growth on any tree, but only those of mankind who have not the seal of God upon their foreheads; they were allowed to torture them for five months, but not to kill them, and their torture was like the torture of a scorpion, when it stings a man. And in those days men will seek death and will not find it; they will long to die, and death flies from them.<br>
			In appearance the locusts were like horses arrayed for battle; on their heads were what looked like crowns of gold; their faces were like human faces, their like women's hair, their teeth like lions' teeth; they had scales like iron breastplates, and the noise of their wings was like the noise of many chariots with horses rushing into battle; they have tails like scorpions, and stings, and their power of hurting men for five months lies in their tails. They have as king over them the angel of the bottomless pit; his name in Hebrew is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abaddon">Abaddon</a>, and in Greek he is called Apollyon.</p>
			<h4>Mark of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beast_(Revelation)">Beast</a></h4>
			<p><strong>13:16-18</strong> Also it causes all, both small and great, both rich and poor, both free and slave, to be marked on the right hand or the forehead, so that no one can buy or sell unless he has the mark, that is, the name of the beast or the number of its name. This calls for wisdom: let him who has understanding reckon the number of the beast, for it is a human number, its number is six hundred and sixty-six.</p>
