			<h1>The Bible</h1>
			<p><em>The Holy Bible</em>. Revised Standard Version, Thomas Nelson & Sons, New York, 1953.</p>
			<h2>The New Testament</h2>
			<h3>Matthew</h3>
			<h4>Camels</h4>
			<p><strong>3:1-4</strong> In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judea, 'Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.' Now John wore a garment of <em>camel's</em> hair, and a leather girdle around his waist; and his food was locusts and wild honey.</p>
			<p><strong>19:20-24</strong> The young man said to him, 'All these [commandments] I have observed; what do I still lack?' Jesus said to him, 'If you would be perfect, go, sell what you possess and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.' When the young man heard this he went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions.<br>
			And Jesus said to his disciples, 'Truly, I say to you, it will be hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven. Again I tell you, it is easier for a <em>camel</em> to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.'</p>
			<p><strong>23:23-24</strong> 'Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you tithe mint and dill and cumin, and have neglected the weightier matters of the law, justice and mercy and faith; these you ought to have done, without neglecting the others. You blind guides, straining out a gnat and swallowing a <em>camel</em>!'</p>
			<ul>

			</ul>
			<hr>
			<p><em>Camels</em> are referenced to evoke discrepancies in size, stature, effect, intent (eye of the needle, gnats)<br>
			Likewise, the narrow and the wide gate</p>
			<p><strong>7:13-14</strong> 'Enter by the narrow gate; for the gate is wide and the way is easy, that leads to destruction, and those who enter by it are many. For the gate is narrow and the way is hard, that leads to life, and those who find it are few.'</p>

			<h4>The Beatitudes 5:3-11</h4>
			<p>Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</p>
			<p>Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.</p>
			<p>Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.</p>
			<p>Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied.</p>
			<p>Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.</p>
			<p>Blessed are the poor in heart, for they shall see God.</p>
			<p>Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</p>
			<p>Blessed are you when men revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account. Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven, for men so persecuted the prophets who were before you.</p>

			<h4>The Lord's Prayer 6:9-13</h4>
			<p>Our Father who art in heaven,<br>
			Hallowed be thy name.<br>
			Thy kingdom come,<br>
			Thy will be done,<br>
			On earth as it is in heaven.<br>
			Give us this day our daily bread;<br>
			And forgive us our debts,<br>
			As we also have forgiven our debtors;<br>
			And lead us not into temptation<br>
			But deliver us from evil.</p>
			<h4>Peace, and the Sword; God, and Family 11:34-39</h4>
			<p>'Do not think that I have come to bring peace on earth; I have not come to bring peace, but a sword. For I have come to set a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; and a man's foes will be those of his own household, he who loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; and he who does not take his cross and follow me is not worthy of me. He who finds his life will lose it, and he who loses his life for my sake will find it.'</p>

			<h4>More Sermon on the Mount</h4>
			<p><strong>6:19-21</strong> 'Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust consume and where thieves break in and steal, but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust consumes and thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.'</p>
			<p><strong>6:22-23</strong> 'The eye is the lamp of the body. So, if your eye is sound, your whole body will be full of light; but if your eye is not sound, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!'</p>
			<p><strong>6:24</strong> 'No one can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.'</p>
			<p><strong>6:25-33</strong> 'Therefore, I tell you, do not be anxious about your life, what you shall eat or what you shall drink, nor about your body, what you shall put on. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing? Look at the birds of the air; they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns; and yet your Heavenly Father feeds them. <em>Are you not of more value than they?</em> And which of you by being anxious can add one cubit to his span of life? And why are you anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they neither toil nor spin; yet I tell you, even <a href=“https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon”>Solomon</a> in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is alive and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not much more clothe you, o men of little faith? Therefore do not be anxious, saying, “What shall we eat?” or “What shall we drink?” or “What shall we wear?” For the Gentiles seek all these things; and your heavenly Father knows that you need them all. But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things shall be yours as well.'</p>
