			<h2>Foreword; The Period, the Protagonist, the Hazards</h2>
			<p>'The genesis of [Tuchman's book] was a desire to find out what were the effects on society ... of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Death">Black Death</a> of 1348-50', 'given the possibilities of [her own] time' ie <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_assured_destruction">M.A.D.</a>, or nuclear holocaust.

			<p>Comparing the aftermaths of the Black Death and of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I">World War I</a> [and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_flu">Spanish flu</a>], <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Westfall_Thompson">James Westfall Thompson</a>found all the same complaints: economic chaos, social unrest, high prices, profiteering, depraved morals, lack of production, industrial insolence, frenetic gaiety, wild expenditure, luxury, debauchery, social and religious hysteria, greed, avarice, maladministration, decay of manners.</p>
			<h3>Thesis</h3>
			<p>The interval of 600 years permits what is significant in human character to stand out. People of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages">Middle Ages</a> existed under mental, moral, and physical circumstances so different from our own as to constitute almost a foreign civilization. As a result, qualities of conduct that we recognize as familiar amid these alien surroundings are revealed as permanent in human nature. If one insists upon a lesson from history, it lies here, as discovered by French medievalist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Édouard_Perroy">Edouard Perroy</a> when he was writing a book on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_Years%27_War">Hundred Years' War</a> while dodging the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestapo">Gestapo</a> during <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II">World War II</a>. 'Certain ways of behavior,' he wrote, 'certain reactions against fate, throw mutual light upon each other.'</p>
			<h3>Historiographic Shift</h3>
			<p>During the three centuries following the 14<sup>th</sup>, history was virtually a genealogy of nobility, devoted to tracing dynastic lines and family connections and infused by the idea of the noble as a superior person.</p>
			<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolution">French Revolution</a> marks the great reversal, following which historians saw the common man as hero, the poor as <em>ipso facto</em> virtuous, nobles and kings as monsters of iniquity.</p>
			<p>Their work is now supplemented and balanced by modern medievalists ... who have taken a more sociological approach and turned up detailed hard facts about daily life.</p>
			<p>Tuchman's Law: The fact of being reported multiplies the apparent extent of any deplorable development by five- to tenfold.</p>
			<p>Disaster is rarely as pervasive as it seems from recorded accounts. The fact of being on the record makes it appear continuous and ubiquitous whereas it is more likely to have been sporadic, both in time and place. Besides, persistence of the normal is usually greater than the effect of disturbance.</p>
			<h2>Chapter 1; "I Am the Sire de Coucy": The Dynasty</h2>
			<p>Household organized under the same officers as the King's: a constable, a grand butler, a master of the falconry and the hunt, a master of the stables, a master of forests and waters, and masters or grand stewards of kitchen, bakery, cellar, fruit (which included spices, and torches and candles for lighting), and furnishings (including tapestry and lodgings during travel). A grand seigneur of this rank also usually employed one or more resident physicians, barbers, priests, painters, musicians, minstrels, secretaries and copyists, an astrologer, a jester, and a dwarf, besides pages and squires.</p>
			<p>Everything that had formed the fief since the tree trunks at Codiciacum (In the earliest Latin documents, Coucy was called Codiciacum or Codiacum, supposedly derived from <em>Codex</em>, <em>codicis</em>, meaning a tree trunk stripped of its branches...) was symbolized in the great lion platform of stone in front of the castle gate where vassals came to present rents and homage. The platform rested on three lions, <em>couchant</em>, one devouring a child, one a dog, and in between them, a third, quiescent. On top was a fourth lion seated in all the majesty the sculptor could evoke. Three times a year - at Easter, Pentecost, and Christmas - the Abbot of Cogent or his agent came to pay homage for the land originally granted to the monks by Aubry de Coucy. The rituals of the ceremony were as elaborate and abstruse as any in the royal crownings at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reims">Reims</a>.</p>
			<p>Mounted on a bay horse (or, according to some accounts, a palomino) with clipped tail and ears and a plow-horse's harness, the abbot's representative carried a whip, a seed bag of wheat, and a basket filled with 120 <em>rissoles</em>. These were crescent-shaped pastries made of rye flour, stuffed with minced veal cooked in oil. A dog followed, also with clipped ears and tail, and with a <em>rissole</em> tied around his neck. The agent circled a stone cross at the entrance to the court three times, cracking his whip on each tour, dismounted and knelt at the lion platform, and, if each detail of equipment and performance was exactly right so far, was allowed to proceed. He then mounted the platform, kissed the lion, and deposited the <em>rissoles</em> plus twelve loaves of bread and three portions of wine as homage. The Sire de Coucy took a third of the offerings, distributed the rest among the assembled bailiffs and town magistrates, and stamped the document of homage with a seal representing a mitered abbot with the feet of a goat.</p>
			<p>Pagan, barbarian, feudal, Christian, accumulated out of the shrouded past, here was medieval society — and the many-layered elements of Western man.</p>
			<h2>Chapter 3; Youth and Chivalry</h2>
			<p>Energy depended on human and animal muscle and on the gear and shaft turned by wind or water. Their power drove mills for tanning and laundering, sawing wood, pressing olive oil, casting iron, mashing hops for beer and pulp for paper and pigment for paints, operating fullers' vats for finishing woolen cloth, bellows for blast furnaces, hydraulic hammers for foundries, and wheels for grindstones used by armorers. The mills had so augmented the use of iron that timberland was already being deforested to supply fuel for the forge. They had so extended human capacity that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Celestine_III">Pope Celestine III</a> in the 1190s ruled that windmills must pay tithes. Unpowered tools - the lathe, brace and bit, spinning wheel, and wheeled plow - had also in the last century increased skills and powers of production.</p>
			<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rota_Fortunae">Fortune's Wheel</a>, plunging down the mighty and (more rarely) raising the lowly, was the prevailing image of the instability of life in an uncertain world. Progress, moral or material, in man or society, was not expected during this life on earth, of which the conditions were fixed. The individual might through his own efforts increase in virtue, but betterment of the whole world would have to await the Second Coming and the beginning of a new age.
			<p>History was finite and contained within comprehensible limits. It began with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genesis_creation_narrative">Creation</a> and was scheduled to end in a not indefinitely remote future with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Coming">Second Coming</a>, which was the hope of afflicted mankind, followed by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Judgment">Day of Judgment</a>. Within that span, man was not subject to social or moral progress because his goal was the next world, not betterment in this. In this world he was assigned to ceaseless struggle against himself in which he might attain individual progress and even victory, but collective betterment would only come in the final union with God.</p>
