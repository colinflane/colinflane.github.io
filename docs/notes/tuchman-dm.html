			<h4 style="color: green">Thesis</h4>
			<p>The interval of 600 years permits what is significant in human character to stand out. People of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages">Middle Ages</a> existed under mental, moral, and physical circumstances so different from our own as to constitute almost a foreign civilization. As a result, qualities of conduct that we recognize as familiar amid these alien surroundings are revealed as permanent in human nature. If one insists upon a lesson from history, it lies here, as discovered by French medievalist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Édouard_Perroy">Edouard Perroy</a> when he was writing a book on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_Years%27_War">Hundred Years' War</a> while dodging the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestapo">Gestapo</a> during <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II">World War II</a>. 'Certain ways of behavior,' he wrote, 'certain reactions against fate, throw mutual light upon each other.'</p>
			<h4 style="color: green">Historiographic Shift</h4>
			<p>During the three centuries following the 14<sup>th</sup>, history was virtually a genealogy of nobility, devoted to tracing dynastic lines and family connections and infused by the idea of the noble as a superior person.</p>
			<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolution">French Revolution</a> marks the great reversal, following which historians saw the common man as hero, the poor as <em>ipso facto</em> virtuous, nobles and kings as monsters of iniquity.</p>
			<p>Their work is now supplemented and balanced by modern medievalists ... who have taken a more sociological approach and turned up detailed hard facts about daily life.</p>
			<p style="color: blue">Tuchman's Law: The fact of being reported multiplies the apparent extent of any deplorable development by five- to tenfold.</p>
			<p>Disaster is rarely as pervasive as it seems from recorded accounts. The fact of being on the record makes it appear continuous and ubiquitous whereas it is more likely to have been sporadic, both in time and place. Besides, persistence of the normal is usually greater than the effect of disturbance.</p>
