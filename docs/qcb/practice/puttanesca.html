			<h2 id="t">theory</h2>
				<p>It is of utmost importance when working with pasta that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form_follows_function">"form follow function" in the selection of <em>shapes</em>. Everyone loves spaghetti, sure, but spaghetti may not always be the best <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_(mythology)">Atlas</a> to a particular earthy gravy. This is the most common mistake made by premature cooks when preparing a pasta dish. They have not allowed themselves sufficient time to ponder the essential mystery of the relationship between gravy, and pasta shape.</p>
				<p>For a puttanesca of this stripe, I suggest a smaller, less linear, more robust shape with lots of surface area, such as a cavatappi, rotelle, or even orecchiette. Either of these will do a phenomenal job of capturing the essence of the gravy cooked in the style of a prostitute.</p>
			<h2 id="e">equipments</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>stove</li>
					<li>stock pot</li>
					<li>wooden spoon</li>
					<li>tongs</li>
					<li>frying pan</li>
					<li>chopping block</li>
					<li>kitchen knife</li>
					<li>can opener</li>
				</ul>
			<h2 id="i">ingredients</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>pasta</li>
					<li>salt</li>
					<li>garlic<a href="#n1">*</a></li>
					<li>hot pepper flakes</li>
					<li>good olive oil</li>
					<li>capers</li>
					<li>kalamata olives</li>
					<li>tomato paste</li>
					<li>peeled tomatoes of the "San Marzano" type, canned</li>
					<li>parsley</li>
				</ul>
			<h2 id="r">recipe</h2>
				<ol type="1">
					<li>fill the stock pot with cold water and set on the stove over high heat
						<ul>
							<li>when water boils vociferously, toss in a handful of salt, then dump in the pasta; stir periodically with the spoon</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>peel, trim, and chop the garlic</li>
					<li>set the frying pan on the stove over medium heat, add a good amount of oil and, when you can smell it, add the hot pepper flakes and garlic and stir frequently</li>
					<li>finely mince the capers, and slice the olives; add to the frying pan and stir frequently</li>
					<li>when things in the frying pan begin to brown becomingly, add the tomato paste, and stir thoroughly to incorporate</li>
					<li>one by one, extricate the peeled tomatoes from their can and crush by hand over the tomato paste mixture in the frying pan; stir to incorporate, then scrape in what remains of the tomatoes' sauce from the can, and stir further</li>
					<li>let the tomato sauce simmer and thicken well, perhaps leaving a lid askance over the pan to prevent the most egregious spatterings</li>
					<li>when pasta is more or less al dente, scoop up the shapes and toss them into the sauce, being sure to allow for sufficient starchy water accompaniment; turn off the stove and toss the shapes in the pan to incorporate among them the essence of the gravy cooked in the style of a prostitute</li>
					<li>chop, shred, and finely mince the parsley, add to the pasta and sauce in the pan, and give the whole thing a few more tosses to incorporate</li>
