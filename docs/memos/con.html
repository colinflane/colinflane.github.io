				<p>While I was away at school my freshman year, my father sent a packet of newspaper articles, "clippings" as he calls them, including a small square carefully torn from the page of a weekly news magazine, with the following quote:</p>
				<p>'The reasonable man adapts himself to the world: the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man.' -- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_and_Superman"><em>Man and Superman</em></a></p>

				<p>"that really woke me up in LA<br>
				you have to learn how to like it more yourself<br>
				you gotta psychologically put your mind to it<br>
				but then I started liking it, after I forced myself"</p>

				<p>'We are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful about what we pretend to be.' -- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_Night"><em>Mother Night</em></a></p>

				<p>'We but mirror the world. All the tendencies present in the outer world are to be found in the world of our body. If we could change ourselves, the tendencies in the world would also change. As a man changes his own nature, so does the attitude of the world change towards him. This is the divine mystery supreme. A wonderful thing it is and the source of our happiness. We need not wait to see what others do.'</p>

				<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYfNvmF0Bqw">One Simple Fact</a></p>
				<p>'When you grow up you tend to get told that the world is the way it is and your life is just to live your life inside the world-try not to bash into the walls too much, try to have a nice family life, have fun, save a little money. But life-that's a very limited life. Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact. And that is everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you. And you can change it-you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use.</p>
				<p>...the most important thing is to shake off this erroneous notion that life is there and you're just gonna live in it, versus embrace it, change it, improve it, make your mark upon it. I think that's very important and however you learn that, once you learn it, you'll want to change life and make it better 'cause it's kind of messed up in a lot of ways. Once you learn that you'll never be the same again.'</p>

				<p>"the ability to create new and better realities and improve conditions<br>
				you look at someone and you know absolutely you can help them<br>
				I won't hesitate to put ethics in on someone else, because I put it ruthlessly in on myself<br>
				we are the authorities on the mind, we are the authorities on improving conditions<br>
				way to happiness, we can bring peace, and unite cultures<br>
				you're either in you're out; that's spectatorism, and it's something that we have no time for right now<br>
				it's our responsibility to educate, create the new reality"</p>
				<br>
				<p>Look: if you are an adult, especially one whom our societal structure has elected to celebrate and champion precisely on account of his cultural contributions to that structure, whatever they may be -- well then, you are allowed to jump on a couch.</p>
