			<h1>Idolatry</h1>
			<p><strong>generative AI models as idols<br>
			in Neo-Neo-Babylon</strong></p>
			<p>different implementations of large language models as gods or deities à la <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergo_Proxy"><em>Ergo Proxy</em></a></p>
			<p>local, civic gods -- each city state (online "community", corporation ?) with its own model trained on its own civic corpus</p>
			<p>waging war on enemy cities, pillaging their corpuses for incorporation with one's own</p>
			<p>a return to the literal theft and appropriation of one's god-idols, as in ancient Babylon</p>
			<p>greater models could be shared among political entities across geographies, perhaps with locally specific (instances) tilts or filters (cults) applied</p>
