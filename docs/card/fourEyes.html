		  <p><strong>In Michael Mann's 'Ferrari' (2023), everyone wears fabulous glasses all of the time.</strong></p>
		  <p>There is much doubling. Of Enzo Ferrari (Adam Driver, 'Marriage Story') and his late older brother Alfredo, whose fates their mother says ought to have been switched; of this Alfredo and his nephew and namesake; of this first, also late, son of Enzo's, and his second, living son, Piero; of these boys' mothers, Enzo's wife Laura (Penélope Cruz, 'All About My Mother') and his mistress Lina; Enzo and his chief rival in the Mille Miglia, Adolfo Orsi, owner of the Maserati team; and two of Ferrari's ill-fated race car drivers.</p>
